# Vision Guide AI ♿

Vision Guide AI is a voice-first accessibility assistant that helps visually impaired users locate and safely reach objects indoors using real-time visual reasoning and natural conversation.

The system uses Google Gemini’s native multimodal capabilities to process live camera input, understand spatial context, and generate step-by-step spoken navigation guidance.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user activates the system and starts a live camera feed.
2. The user gives a natural voice command (e.g., “Find my glasses”).
3. Gemini’s native multimodal model reasons over live visual frames.
4. The system transitions from scanning to guidance mode.
5. Step-by-step spoken navigation instructions guide the user to the object.
